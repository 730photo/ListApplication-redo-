# ListApplication-redo-

<h1>I didn't do this app correctly the first time around and that kept bothering me, so I attempted it again and it came out perfect!

<h3>In doing this app I learned:</h3>

<h4>how to use ListView to display a list.</h4>
<h4>how to create a custom layout component to make a simple app.</h4>
<h4>how to incorporate images with ImageView.</h4>

I created a list with 3 items along with their price and description. When you click an item(I clicked the apples) the emulator switches screens to an image of the item.
